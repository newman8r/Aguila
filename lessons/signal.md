# Signal Processing Fundamentals

## Overview
This lesson covers the fundamental concepts of digital signal processing (DSP) as applied to radio signals. DSP is the mathematical manipulation of signals to extract information, filter noise, and prepare signals for analysis or transmission.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamentals of sampling theory and digital signal representation
- Learn about time and frequency domain analysis of signals
- Explore filtering techniques and their applications in radio
- Gain insights into Fourier transforms and spectral analysis
- Apply signal processing concepts to real-world radio problems

## Topics Covered
1. Sampling theory and the Nyquist-Shannon theorem
2. Analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion
3. Time domain and frequency domain representations
4. Fourier transforms (DFT, FFT) and their applications
5. Digital filtering techniques:
   - FIR filters
   - IIR filters
   - Window functions
6. Spectral analysis methods
7. Signal detection and extraction techniques

## Hands-on Activities
- Implement basic signal processing algorithms
- Analyze time and frequency domain representations of radio signals
- Design and implement digital filters for radio applications
- Perform spectral analysis of real-world signals
- Extract weak signals from noise using DSP techniques
