# FM Modulation

## Overview
This lesson explores Frequency Modulation (FM), an advanced modulation technique that encodes information by varying the frequency of the carrier wave. FM offers significant advantages over AM in many applications, especially for high-fidelity audio broadcasting.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the principle of frequency modulation
- Learn how information is encoded by varying signal frequency
- Explore the mathematical representation of FM signals
- Compare FM with AM in terms of noise immunity and bandwidth
- Understand FM demodulation techniques

## Topics Covered
1. Basic principles of frequency modulation
2. Mathematical representation of FM signals
3. Bandwidth considerations in FM transmission
4. Noise performance and capture effect
5. FM transmitter and receiver architectures
6. Applications of FM in broadcasting, communications, and more

## Hands-on Activities
- Build a simple FM modulator circuit
- Use SDR to visualize FM signals in time and frequency domains
- Demodulate FM signals using different techniques
- Compare audio quality between AM and FM broadcast signals
- Experiment with FM's noise immunity characteristics
