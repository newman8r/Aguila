# AM Modulation

## Overview
This lesson covers Amplitude Modulation (AM), one of the fundamental techniques for transmitting information via radio waves. AM was one of the earliest modulation techniques and remains important for understanding radio principles.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the principle of amplitude modulation
- Learn how information is encoded by varying signal amplitude
- Explore the mathematical representation of AM signals
- Gain insights into AM demodulation techniques
- Understand the advantages and limitations of AM broadcasting

## Topics Covered
1. Basic principles of modulation and why it's necessary
2. Mathematical representation of AM signals: carrier, modulating signal, and modulated wave
3. Sidebands in AM and bandwidth requirements
4. AM transmitter and receiver architectures
5. Double-sideband, single-sideband, and vestigial sideband AM variants
6. Practical applications and limitations of AM

## Hands-on Activities
- Build a simple AM modulator circuit
- Use SDR to visualize AM signals in time and frequency domains
- Demodulate AM signals using different techniques
- Compare audio quality of different AM variants
