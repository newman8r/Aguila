Aguila is a signals analysis platform build on top of Gqrx: open source software defined radio (SDR) receiver implemented using
[GNU Radio](https://gnuradio.org) and the [Qt GUI toolkit](https://www.qt.io/).
Currently it works on Linux and Mac with hardware supported by gr-osmosdr,
including Funcube Dongle, RTL-SDR, Airspy, HackRF, BladeRF, RFSpace, USRP and
SoapySDR.

Gqrx can operate as an AM/FM/SSB receiver with audio output or as an FFT-only
instrument. There are also various hooks for interacting with external
applications using network sockets.

Download
--------

Gqrx is distributed as a source code package and binaries for Linux and Mac.
Many Linux distributions provide gqrx in their package repositories.
Alternate Mac support is available through [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/gqrx/summary) and [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/gqrx).
Windows support is available through [radioconda](https://github.com/ryanvolz/radioconda#radioconda).

* [Official releases](https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx/releases)
* [Pre-release builds](https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild+branch%3Amaster)

Usage
-----

It is strongly recommended to run the `volk_profile` utility before
running gqrx. This will detect and enable processor-specific optimisations and
will in many cases give a significant performance boost.

The first time you start gqrx it will open a device configuration dialog.
Supported devices that are connected to the computer are discovered
automatically and you can select any of them in the drop-down list.

If you don't see your device listed in the drop-down list it could be because:
- The driver has not been included in a binary distribution
- The udev rule has not been properly configured
- Linux kernel driver is blocking access to the device

You can test your device using device specific tools, such as rtl_test,
airspy_rx, hackrf_transfer, qthid, etc.

Gqrx supports multiple configurations and sessions if you have several devices
or if you want to use the same device under different configurations. You can
load a configuration from the GUI or using the `-c` command line argument. See
`gqrx --help` for a complete list of command line arguments.

Tutorials and howtos are being written and published on the website

Known problems
--------------

See the bug tracker on Github: https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx/issues


Getting help and reporting bugs
-------------------------------

There is a Google group for discussing anything related to Gqrx:
https://groups.google.com/g/gqrx
This includes getting help with installation and troubleshooting. Please
remember to provide detailed description of your problem, your setup, what
steps you followed, etc.

Please stick around and help others with their problems. Otherwise, if only
developers provide user support there will be no more time for further
development.


Installation from source
------------------------

The source code is hosted on Github: https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx

To compile gqrx from source you need the following dependencies:
- GNU Radio 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10 with the following components:
    - gnuradio-runtime
    - gnuradio-analog
    - gnuradio-audio
    - gnuradio-blocks
    - gnuradio-digital
    - gnuradio-fft
    - gnuradio-filter
    - gnuradio-network (GNU Radio 3.10 only)
    - gnuradio-pmt
- The gr-iqbalance library (optional)
- Drivers for the hardware you want to have support for:
    - Funcube Dongle Pro driver via gr-fcd
    - UHD driver via gr-uhd
    - Funcube Dongle Pro+ driver from https://github.com/dl1ksv/gr-fcdproplus
    - RTL-SDR driver from https://gitea.osmocom.org/sdr/rtl-sdr
    - HackRF driver from https://github.com/mossmann/hackrf
    - Airspy driver from https://github.com/airspy/airspyone_host
    - SoapySDR from https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR
    - RFSpace driver is built in
- gnuradio-osmosdr from https://gitea.osmocom.org/sdr/gr-osmosdr
- pulseaudio or portaudio (Linux-only and optional)
- Qt 5 or Qt 6 with the following components:
    - Core
    - GUI
    - Network
    - Widgets
    - Svg (runtime-only)
- cmake version >= 3.2.0

Gqrx can be compiled from within Qt Creator or in a terminal:

For command line builds:
<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx.git gqrx.git
$ cd gqrx.git
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
</pre>
On some systems, the default cmake release builds are "over-optimized" and
perform poorly. In that case try forcing -O2 using
<pre>
export CXXFLAGS=-O2
</pre>
before the cmake step.

For Qt Creator builds:
<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx.git gqrx.git
$ cd gqrx.git
$ mkdir build
Start Qt Creator
Open gqrx.git/CMakeLists.txt file
At the dialog asking for build location, select gqrx.git/build
click continue
If asked to choose cmake executable, do so
click continue
click the run cmake button
click done
optionally, on the Projects page, under Build Steps/Make/Additional arguments,
	enter -j4 (replacing 4 with the number of cores in your CPU).
Use Qt Creator as before
</pre>


Debugging
---------

Debug logging can be enabled by setting the `QT_LOGGING_RULES` environment
variable:

```
QT_LOGGING_RULES="*.debug=true;plotter.debug=false;qt.*.debug=false" gqrx
```

To turn on plotter debugging as well, use the following command:

```
QT_LOGGING_RULES="*.debug=true;qt.*.debug=false" gqrx
```

# Aguila SDR Platform

## SDR Device Management

### Switching Between SDR Devices
To prevent configuration conflicts when switching between different SDR devices (e.g., HackRF and RTL-SDR), use the provided `sdr_switch.sh` script:

1. Close GQRX completely if it's running
2. Run the script with your desired device:
   ```bash
   # For HackRF:
   ./resources/sdr_switch.sh hackrf

   # For RTL-SDR:
   ./resources/sdr_switch.sh rtlsdr
   ```
3. Launch GQRX normally

The script will:
- Back up your current GQRX configuration
- Restore device-specific settings if available
- Create a fresh configuration if needed
- Automatically save working configurations for each device

This prevents configuration conflicts and segmentation faults that can occur when switching between different SDR devices.

### Troubleshooting Device Switching
If you encounter issues:
1. Close GQRX completely
2. Run the switch script for your desired device
3. Launch GQRX fresh

Your device-specific configurations will be saved automatically when GQRX exits normally.
